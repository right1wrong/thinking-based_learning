The classic ways of learning cs include study cs at colleges and learn popular online classes or tutorials. But following those methods are just following
others' understanding of computer science. It's effective because you can get a general understanding of computer science in public eyes. But it can hardly
lead to your own creations since you rarely have the chance to think about topics in computer science based on your understanding of the world. What you have
done is to understand and absorb other's inventions and understandings.

Someone may argue that we have to first accept others' ideas when people don't have enough basic knowledge of the world. But what is the basic knowledge of the world?
Human first learn languages and living skills from their parents and surroundings. These knowledges are all about naming objects and their beheviors, plus controlling our bodies to achieve something.
So everyone have relatively large vocabulary and movement abilities can begin to learn any subjects in the world by using their own minds! I'm not talking about
traditional learning ways like listen to teachers. They are important. You also use your brain when you are listening to others. But the main part of your brain focuses on understanding what others say instead of thinking on your mind!
You may argue that understanding is also a kind of thinking ability based on their brain functions. Yes. The process is that you decode the information delivered by certain languge and...
And what? You either find it doesn't make sense based on your logic or just agree with it and store what you have received! That's the problem of traditional learning methods because we've preset that the information is correct and should be saved in our memory once you understand it!
Actuallly it's a good as well as lazy process that our brain has developed to learn about the environment fast and gain some advantages during natural selections.
But the funniest thing here is that the information from our peers can be easily wrong when the competition is getting intense. That's why you'd better not digest online information more than what you have learned through schools.
There are at least some stricted evaluation processes when information and knowledge get delivered at schools. Sadly, they can be wrong too as we human keep explore the world.
So it's necessary to master another learning method which can create knowledge based on your understanding of the world.

Taking the example of learning computer science, we can directly create our own learning journey because we have already got basic understanding of the world.

When you want to learn some subjects, the first thing comes to your mind is that you want to know what it is. So what is computer science?
Don't look at the boring definitions of computer science summarized by other experts. They are good summarizations but not the real thing you want to learn about.
When you ask "What", you should refer to the history of the subject because it can tell you the birth of what you are asking for. Before that, there is not that thing. Neither is your question nor your learning.

Tracking back to the age without computers, we can still find people always seek for tools to aid the process of calculation. In mathmatics, there is a great part of knowledge which describes how people conduct complex computation wisely.
Computer is just another tool that we invented to help us to do the process like how we create other machines or devices. How did we develop this kind of machine?
And how can we improve it? How can it be used to fix problems in daily life? All of these are included in computer science.
Similarly, you can use the three questions above to learn any subjects because that's just how we human live. No matter it is our language development or fundational subjects like math, physics, literture, arts and so on, all of them are just abstactions of the real world developed in our minds.
Math is a collection of signs
