What do we learn about math at the begining?
Or we can ask how math was created? The following is an official version of math history from wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematics#:~:text=The%20earliest%20evidence%20of%20written,of%20metrology%20from%203000%20BC.

But I want to bring up a new way of thinking about questions. Let's start from the most basic thing in math: number 1. What does 1 mean?
Most people may think it is easy to answer. 1 means there is only one subject. But how can we get the idea of 1 only by learning through fruits of different numbers in kindergraten?
We point at one apple and say there is only 1 apple. We point at another two apples and teach kids number 2. Ourr kids can easily use these numbers when we point at other fruits or candies in different number.
It seems like a pretty intuitive learning process. But the ability to use number 1 in different scenarios is acctually an ability of abstraction. This is the first component of math.
It's not like how we learn languages. People only need to correlate certain sounds and words with different objects when learning their mother tongue.
When learning math, we need first abstract the concept such as 1 from specific objects. There is no physical existings in math world.
Thinking of abstraction reminded me of the textbook we used in junior and senior high school in China. I remember there are four or five basic thinking modes of abilities when learning and exploring math.
They are summarized very concisely and inspirationally. But most students only care about how to get high scores for exams. So did I. But I could't help to read and think about those summarization.
